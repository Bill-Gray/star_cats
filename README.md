# star_cats
Code to access star catalogue data.  Thus far,  this means UCAC4 and
Dave Tholen's Gaia32 (compressed,  re-sorted Gaia DR1),  and for
CMC-14 and CMC-15.

Code for other catalogues will be added as I get around to it (I have
code for the other UCACs,  Ax.0,  Bx.0,  and more...  just not posted yet.)
