# star_cats
Code to access star catalogue data.  Thus far,  this means UCACs 2,
3,  and 4;  URAT1;  Dave Tholen's Gaia32 (compressed,  re-sorted Gaia DR1
and,  later,  DR2 with just the bits needed for asteroid astrometry);
and for CMC-14 and CMC-15.

Code for other catalogues will be added as I get around to it (I have
code for UCAC1,  Ax.0,  Bx.0,  GSC-1.x,  and more...  just not posted yet;
I've focussed on catalogues people are most likely to use.)
